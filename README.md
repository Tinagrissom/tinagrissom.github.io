ðŸ“š Look it Up ðŸ“–

My app allows users to search for the definition of a word.

I used Ajax and jQuery to call an API from Merriam-Webster to populate the data I wanted the user to see.

I added a <form> in my HTML with an input box and a submit button. This is where the user will input the word they wish to look up, and generate the search.

I used a modal box to display the definitions, and created a for loop that would only show the first two definitions.
